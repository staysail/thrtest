= thrtest - thread primitive testing (microbenchmarks)

This program is for use on POSIX systems (Linux, illumos, BSD, macOS, etc.)
It measures some primitive operations such as handoff latency when switching
between threads for condition variables, mutexes, and so forth.

The idea is to be able to get some basic idea of typical overheads for using
threading synchronization primitives.

You can build this with CMake, or just compile the .c and link against
your pthread library, such as:

```
% $(CC) thrtest.c -l pthread -o thrtest
```
